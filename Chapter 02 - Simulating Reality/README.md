# 📁 Chapter 2 - Simulating Reality

### 🪐 Project: Star Gravity Simulator - Two-Body Simulation

This project simulates the gravitational attraction between two bodies in 2D space using Newton's law of universal gravitation.

### Concepts Covered
- Newtonian gravity
- Euler integration for physics
- Real-time visualization using matplotlib

### How to Run
Make sure you have `matplotlib` and `numpy` installed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
Then run:
``` bash
python main.py
```
### Try This!

- Adjust the masses or velocities to see different orbits.
- Try adding a third body and watch the chaos!
